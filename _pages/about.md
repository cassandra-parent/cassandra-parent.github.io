Hello! My name is Cassandra (Cassie) Parent, and I'm a joint research assistant with Johns Hopkins and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso. My research focuses on using data-driven approaches to decrease healthcare disparities in underserved Latino populations. Broadly, I am interested in developing explainable machine learning tools for social good. 

Previously, I have worked with Prof. Suchi Saria on analyzing provider factors that increased interaction with a machine learning sepsis decision support tool. I am currently working as a part-time culsutant for the start-up [Bayesian Health](https://www.bayesianhealth.com/) which is a spin-out from Prof. Saria's research. 

Please feel free to contact me!
