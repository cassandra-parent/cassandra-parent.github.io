Hello! My name is Cassandra (Cassie) Parent, and I'm a joint research assistant with Johns Hopkins and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso. My research focuses on using data-driven approaches to [decrease healthcare disparities](https://jphmpdirect.com/2022/10/06/expanding-access-to-covid-19-vaccines-to-latinos-with-limited-english-proficiency-during-the-early-phases-of-vaccination/) in underserved Latino populations. 

Broadly, I am interested in developing explainable machine learning tools for social good. 

Previously, I have worked with Prof. Suchi Saria on [analyzing provider factors](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01895-z) that increased interaction with a machine learning sepsis decision support tool. I am currently working as a part-time culsutant for the start-up [Bayesian Health](https://www.bayesianhealth.com/) which is a spin-out from Prof. Saria's research. 

Please feel free to contact me with any questions!
