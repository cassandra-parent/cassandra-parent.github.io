Hello! My name is Cassandra (Cassie) Parent, and I'm a PhD student at MIT and Harvard Medical School in the Medical Engineering and Medical Physics program, supervised by advised by [Prof. Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/). My research broadly focuses on developing equitable machine learning tools for underserved health conditions. 

Previously, I have worked with Prof. Suchi Saria at Johns Hopkins University on [analyzing provider factors](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01895-z) that increased interaction with a machine learning sepsis decision support tool. I have also worked as an intern at [Bayesian Health](https://www.bayesianhealth.com/) which spun out of the lab's research.

I have also served as a research assistant at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine where I focused on using data-driven approaches to [decrease healthcare disparities](https://jphmpdirect.com/2022/10/06/expanding-access-to-covid-19-vaccines-to-latinos-with-limited-english-proficiency-during-the-early-phases-of-vaccination/) in underserved Latino populations. Previously, I also worked as a machine learning intern for [Oncospace](https://oncospace.com/) where I used predicted adverse side effects from cancer treatments. Finally, I led my undergraduate captsone project team in developing a novel internal hemorrhage diagnostic tool for prehospital settings. We raised over $75,000 in student grants, have presented our work at the Military Health Science and Research Symposium, and submitted a patent for the device.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions!
