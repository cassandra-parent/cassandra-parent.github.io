When I'm not working, I have way too many hobbies...
- Check out my art on Instagram [@threading_water_](https://www.instagram.com/threading_water_/)
- I traveled solo for a year, made it my whole personality, and now I share iteneraries and tips on Medium [@Gorgeous Girls Go Globetrotting](https://gorgeousgirlsgoglobetrotting.medium.com/).
- I also read a lot so friend me on Goodreads [@clparent121](https://www.goodreads.com/clparent121)!
- I also occasionally write for the MIT grad blog. You can find my latest blog post here.
