## Not Science
When I'm not working, I have way too many hobbies including hiking, writing, reading, and more!
- Check out my art on Instagram [@threading_water_](https://www.instagram.com/threading_water_/)
- I traveled solo for a year and made it my whole personality. I documented my time [here](https://gorgeousgirlsgoglobetrotting.medium.com/) where I share insider iteneraries to unique places!
- I also occasionally write for the MIT grad blog. You can find my latest blog post here.
- I also read a lot so friend me on Goodreads [@clparent121](https://www.goodreads.com/clparent121)!
